# MangaReader
MangaReader is a simple IOS app that allows you to read manga from the internet. It is written in Swift 4.2 and uses the MVVM architecture. It uses the [MangaDex](https://api.mangadex.org/).This app was previously on the app store but I pulled it out of caution when I found out mangadex does not hold the copyrights to work shared via its api. I am proud of the work I accomplished on this app but can no longer host it on the App Store becuse of this.
